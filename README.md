# Open AI Gym
Creating Game Bot for CartPole Game in openAI Gym with Simple neural network ( not Reinforcement Learning ).

we Brute force all the possible action and store that action. after that it is as simple as training for classification problem.

# Before Training 
we play with random action Bot continously fail and fall from cart. <b> Average score for 50 game is 25 point .</b>

# After training
After collecting all data and train on it . we can predict our action  by observation .
Now Bot is showing some imporvement and our <b> Average score for 10 game is 190 point. </b> prety good for simple feedforward network
